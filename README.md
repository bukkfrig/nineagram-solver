# nineagram-solver

The goal in solving a Nineagram puzzle is to find two five-letter words
from the nine letters provided that share the same middle letter.

For example, given AAEEHPPSS, one solution is PEARS and SHAPE:

```
        P
        E
    S H A P E
        R
        S
```

The main way that the Program assists the user is by displaying the remaining
letters after the player guesses at one of the words.

The Program can also find and display solutions by exhaustively searching
its own word list.
